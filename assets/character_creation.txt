- Halfling: small and stealthy

Class:
- Warrior: strong and skilled in combat
- Mage: knowledgeable in the arcane arts
- Rogue: cunning and stealthy
- Cleric: devoted to a deity and skilled in divine magic

Ability Scores:
- Strength: determines your physical power
- Dexterity: determines your agility and reflexes
- Constitution: determines your health and endurance
- Intelligence: determines your knowledge and problem-solving skills

- Charisma: determines your personality and social skills

Roll four six-sided dice and add up the three highest rolls for each ability score. Assign the resulting scores to the abilities of your choice.

Good luck and have fun!
